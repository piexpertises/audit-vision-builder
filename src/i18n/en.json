  "emergency_prep": {
    "title": "Emergency Preparedness | Ready for Any Scenario",
    "subtitle": "Are you ready for emergencies?",
    "intro": "Emergency situations can occur suddenly and unexpectedly, sometimes crossing geographic, social, and economic boundaries. Whether natural disasters (earthquakes, pandemics, tsunamis) or man-made events (terrorist attacks, war, fires), these situations directly impact organizational continuity and can lead to infrastructure collapse and community overload. At Pi Expertises, we believe such events are not 'black swans' - such scenarios can and should be anticipated, planned for, and managed intelligently. Every organization, business, or institution must be prepared for emergencies, and that's where we come in.",
    "help_title": "How Do We Help You Prepare?",
    "help_desc": "Emergency preparedness requires thorough and comprehensive planning, including not only building routine plans, but also dealing with exceptional situations, various scenarios, and preparing the organization for immediate action under pressure. Building emergency plans combined with comprehensive security concepts, organizational resilience, and business continuity will provide a holistic solution ensuring the organization not only survives the crisis but can continue operating efficiently.",

    "bcp_desc": "The ability to continue operating under difficult and changing conditions, without critical services and business activities being harmed. Definition and implementation of BCP allows organizations to deal with any crisis or disaster professionally and systematically, and avoid economic catastrophes due to inability to operate.

    "drp_title": "What is DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan)?",
    "drp_desc": "A DRP plan focuses on technological response, aiming to restore all IT systems damaged during a crisis.

    "resilience_title": "Organizational Resilience – The Leading Factor for Success",
    "resilience_desc": "Psychological resilience is a critical component for organizational success during emergencies. Mental support for employees, resilience training, and adopting an organizational culture based on flexibility and ability to deal with crises can make the difference between survival and catastrophe. In crisis or trauma situations, the organization can develop organizational resilience, enabling people to continue working and functioning optimally even under pressure. This is one of the central components in preparing for any emergency scenario.",
    "advantage_title": "Business Advantage in Crisis",
    "advantage_desc": "The crisis itself, if handled properly, can turn into a business advantage. An organization capable of maintaining its operation professionally and correctly during emergency – will emerge from the crisis with stronger reputation, higher customer loyalty, and ability to maintain successful business relationships over time. An organization responding quickly, professionally, and efficiently becomes the organizational 'beacon' that radiates trust, stability, and resilience.",
